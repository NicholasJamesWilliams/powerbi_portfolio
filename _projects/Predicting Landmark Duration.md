  Photo sharing and photo storage services thrive on location data for the images uploaded by their users. 
  Location data enables useful features like automatic tagging suggestions and organization of photos, greatly 
  enhancing the user experience. However, many uploaded photos lack location metadata due to reasons like cameras 
  lacking GPS or privacy concerns removing metadata.
