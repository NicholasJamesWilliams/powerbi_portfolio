description: >
  In this project, we will define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Our goal is to get a generator network to 
  generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible! The project will be broken down into a series of 
  tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, we will be able 
  to visualize the results of our trained Generator to see how it performs; our generated samples should look like 
  fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
