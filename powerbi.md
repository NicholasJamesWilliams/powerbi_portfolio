# Power BI Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a selection of interactive Power BI dashboards that I have designed and developed to solve real business problems. Each one highlights my strengths in data modeling, DAX measures, Power Query transformations, and effective visual storytelling tailored for stakeholders. These solutions have helped drive strategic decision-making, uncover root causes, and boost performance across various business functions.

## ðŸ”¹ Performance Dashboard

This dashboard provides a high-level overview of critical business KPIs across sales, operations, and finance. It was developed using data from multiple sources, cleaned and merged in Power Query to ensure integrity and consistency. Advanced DAX measures were created to calculate trends, moving averages, and YOY comparisons. Key performance tiles, dynamic filtering, and trend analysis visuals allow users to explore performance over time and drill into areas of concern.

## ðŸ”¹ Agents Performance

Built to optimize workforce efficiency, this dashboard tracks KPIs for individual agents such as call volumes, resolution rates, and average handling time. The data model incorporates time intelligence to show performance by day, week, or shift. I used Power Query to reshape service logs and DAX to derive performance scoring and SLA adherence. Conditional formatting and tooltips were added for at-a-glance insights into underperforming agents.

## ðŸ”¹ Geo-Sales Dashboard

This report uses geospatial data visualisation to provide insight into regional sales performance. It combines sales order data with postcode mapping to enable geographic drilldowns by region, district, and postcode. Power Query merges external postcode reference data, while custom DAX measures calculate regional targets, conversion rates, and profitability. The map visual is enhanced with tooltips and slicers to support sales strategy and territory planning.

## ðŸ”¹ Root Cause Dashboard

Designed for operations and quality assurance teams, this dashboard helps uncover the underlying causes of performance issues. I implemented dimension hierarchies and used Power Query to classify data into failure types and categories. Advanced DAX was used for filtering and cross-highlighting issue types across timelines. The output includes Pareto charts, dynamic filters, and decomposition trees to support Six Sigma-style analysis and continuous improvement initiatives.

## ðŸ”¹ Sales Teams Performance

This dashboard compares team and individual sales performance using KPIs like revenue, conversion rate, sales pipeline stages, and goal attainment. Built with an optimized star schema data model, I used DAX to compute cumulative sales, forecast projections, and rank-based metrics. The visuals are fully interactive and include bar charts, donut visuals, and slicers for team, region, and month. This is a key tool for sales managers tracking team contribution and goal tracking.

## ðŸ”¹ NPS Report

This Net Promoter Score dashboard presents customer feedback segmented by product, service type, and sentiment theme. I used Power BI's Q&A feature and sentiment tagging from structured survey data, parsed and cleaned in Power Query. DAX was used to generate average scores, promoter/detractor percentages, and NPS deltas over time. It's designed to help Customer Success teams understand satisfaction drivers and track loyalty initiatives.

## ðŸ”¹ James Bond Report (For Fun ðŸŽ¬)

A personal project created for fun, this dashboard analyses data on the James Bond film franchise, including actor appearances, box office revenue, critical ratings, and iconic gadgets. Data was collected via web scraping and transformed in Power Query. DAX measures were used to compare actors by ROI, film frequency, and era. It's a playful demonstration of Power BIâ€™s ability to tell stories and make cultural data engaging.
