  about: >
    My name is Zakaria Alsahfi, and I am the Director of Information Affairs at the University of Business and Technology.|
    My primary responsibility is to interpret large amounts of data to understand trends in student enrollment and to ensure 
    that accurate and relevant information is provided to both authorized external and internal stakeholders. In my role, 
    I am privileged to have the opportunity to create and optimize workflows, which significantly improves efficiency. 
    I also analyze extensive data sets and extract insights that propel the business forward, primarily using tools 
    such as spreadsheets and Power BI. My introduction to predictive modeling using Python (having started with R 
    but transitioning to Python) has opened a new realm of possibilities for me. I have embraced this evolution, dedicating 
    myself to a deeper exploration of all things data-related.| This blog/portfolio is a showcase of the projects I have completed,
    those that are in progress, and a documentation of my learnings as I delve further into the data world. It's been an exhilarating
    journey thus far, and I am committed to continually enriching this platform with my experiences and insights.
