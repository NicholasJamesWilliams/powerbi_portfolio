  about: >
    My name is Zakaria Alsahfi, and I am the director of information affairs at the University of Business and Technology.
    My job is mainly interpreting large amounts of data to understand the student enrollment to ensure that provides information 
    to authorized external and internal stakeholders. As part of my job, I have the opportunity to create and optimize workflows 
    to improve efficiency, analyze large amounts of data, and extract insights to move the business forward (primarily using tools 
    such as spreadsheets and Power BI). Then I got introduced to predictive modeling using Python (I started with R but ended up 
    with Python), which opened up a new world of possibilities. So naturally, I decided to lean into it and deepen my knowledge 
    of everything data. This blog/portfolio shows the projects I have completed, projects in progress, and documentation of my learnings
    as I go deeper into this world. It has been an exciting journey, and I plan to keep adding to it!
