              An insurance group comprises 10 property and casualty insurance, life insurance, and insurance brokerage companies. The property and casualty companies in the group operate in a 17-state region. The group consists of significant regional property and casualty insurers, represented by more than 4,000 independent agents who live and work in local communities through a six-state region. The objective is to improve the agentsâ€™ existing knowledge used for agent segmentation in a supervised predictive framework.
