              This dashboard provides insights into coffee quality data. It gives an overview of key metrics like acidity, density, 
              body, and flavor ratings to evaluate the overall quality of the coffee. Moreover, the different coffee types and regions 
              identify opportunities to improve specific coffee varieties and growing locations. The visuals on the dashboard allow 
              both production managers and quality inspectors to detect issues, find correlations, and spot trends in coffee quality over time 
              so they can take corrective actions to ensure optimal coffee is produced and roasted.
