             The Analytics team of an Online E-Commerce Company wants to design a Sales dashboard to analyze the sales 
             based on various product categories. The company wants to add user control for product categories, so users 
             can select a category and can see the trend month-wise and product-wise accordingly. The Analytics team 
             also wants to create a histogram to analyze the number of shipping days.
