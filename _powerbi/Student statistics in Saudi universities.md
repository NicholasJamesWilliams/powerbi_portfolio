              This study aims to determine enrollment trends and popular majors at Saudi universities to help advance higher education. 
              Analyzing data on enrolled, newly enrolled, and graduated students classified by factors like major, institution type, gender, 
              and nationality can provide insight into determining the market share of governmental and private institutions. Understanding 
              trends and popular majors can help universities improve programs to attract more students. Determining market share provides 
              insights to improve strategic planning and competitiveness. The data was collected from the Saudi Ministry of Education. Key 
              findings may reveal which university types and programs are most in-demand, informing necessary changes. Policymakers can use 
              results to identify gaps and allocate resources effectively. The goal is to provide information that helps Saudi universities 
              better serve students and communities.
